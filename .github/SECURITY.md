# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The Respy.Tech team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in our website or API, please report it by emailing us at:

**Email:** [contact@respy.tech](mailto:contact@respy.tech)

Please include the following information:

1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce the issue

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within 48 hours with an initial assessment. We will keep you updated as we work to address the issue.

## Security Measures

Respy.Tech employs several security measures to protect user data and ensure the integrity of our services:

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

We implement a strict Content Security Policy to mitigate XSS and data injection attacks. Our policy restricts:
- JavaScript execution to our own domain and trusted CDNs
- Style sources to our own domain and specific trusted sources
- Connection sources to only necessary API endpoints
- Image, font, and media resources to verified sources

### HTTP Security Headers

We implement the following security headers across our application:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to prevent MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` to prevent clickjacking attacks
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` for additional XSS protection
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` to limit referrer information
- `Permissions-Policy` to restrict access to sensitive browser features

### API Security

Our API endpoints implement:
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Proper error handling to avoid information disclosure
- Caching strategies with appropriate TTLs
- CORS policies to restrict cross-origin requests

### Third-Party API Providers

When connecting to third-party API providers, we:
- Use HTTPS for all connections
- Implement timeouts to prevent hanging connections
- Handle errors gracefully
- Do not store sensitive provider data

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Scope

This policy applies to all repositories and code hosted at https://github.com/respy-tech and all services operating under the respy.tech domain.

### Expectations

When reporting vulnerabilities:
- Allow a reasonable time for the issue to be addressed before disclosing publicly
- Do not access or modify user data without explicit permission
- Do not degrade the operation of our services
- Do not engage in social engineering or physical attacks against our infrastructure

### Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in accordance with this policy to be:
- Authorized under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
- Exempt from DMCA restrictions on circumvention of technological measures
- Authorized under applicable anti-hacking laws

We will not initiate legal action against individuals who follow this policy.

## Attribution

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve our security. With your permission, we will acknowledge your contribution once the issue is resolved.
